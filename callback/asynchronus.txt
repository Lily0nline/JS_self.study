Asynchronous programming allows you to move a specific task to the background. 
While you wait for this task to finish, the main program continues to run.

JavaScript = single threaded language

A thread is like a virtual machine that is able to execute code independently of other threads within the same process.

Think of a single-lane road. Only one car can travel on it at a time.
That's not a problem as long as all cars keep moving at the same speed.
But if one car stops the entire road is blocked until that car can start moving again. 

Similarly, the execution of Javascript could be blocked by a slow or time consuming piece of code.
Since JavaScript hasonly only thread, it can execute only one piece of code at a time

This way of executing code in order from start to finish is called synchronous programming.

synchronous programming comes with certain disadvantages.

In JavaScript we often have tasks that take some time to complete. 
For example, sometimes we have to make a request to a backend API to get data.

In this case, the request must first arrive at the backend server. 
Then the server has to collect the requested dataand send it back.
From a programming pov this is a lot of time.

If we were to use synchronous programming for this request, our programme 
would have to wait until the request was completed before it could execute any other code.
In other words, out program would freeze in the meantime.

setTimeout() method is a built-in function (내장함수) 
in javaScript that allows you to execute a function after a specified amount of time has passed.

The method requires 2 arguments:
 The first argument is the function that you want to execute after the delay. aka function name
 The second argument is the delay time in milliseconds. ex) 3 seconds => 3000

What makes this method asynchronous is that during the delay time, execution of other tasks is not blocked. 
That's why code lines that come after the setTimeout() method are executed before the delay is completed.

One final note about setTimeout(): You can call setTimeout() without a delay argument or with a delay of 0. 
However, the function that you pass to setTimeout() will still be moved to the end of the so-called execution queue.

        ex) 
        let i = 0; //declare the value of the var i 
        function func() { 
        i = 2; //declare new value for i
        console.log(i); // print i new value 
        }
        setTimeout(func, 0); //call func but move it to the end of the queue
        console.log(i); // print i 
        // expected output 0, 2
